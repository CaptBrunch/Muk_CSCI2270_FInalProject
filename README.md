# Muk_CSCI2270_FinalProject
For my final project I want to do something similar to the zombies assignment of assignment 9, but I want to do a travel guide that is based around the United States. I also want to add I way to calculate the cost of travel and the cheapest way to do so and the quickest way to travel from point a to point b. I will be mainly using graph but I still need to think of any other way to do so to make the program a lot more efficient.

Just have the text files bestCities.txt and landMarks.txt and run it with the main program.
System Requirements: Windows, Mac, Linux
